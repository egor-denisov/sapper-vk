## About the game

A classic minesweeper game in which you need to open all the cells without mines.
- Field 16x16
- 40 mines
- In the upper left corner there is a counter of mines not marked with a flag
- In the upper right corner there is a stopwatch
- Cells can be set with a flag (right-click) or a question (right-click again)
- To restart the game, click on the smiley face in the center
## Features

- When you click on a cell and move to another one, the one that is now under the mouse cursor will open
- By clicking on an open non-empty cell, you can view its "neighbors"
- If the number of flags on the field becomes 40 (the number of mines), then it becomes impossible to put flags
- The user's first click never hits a mine
- In case of defeat, the fields in which the flags were incorrectly placed are highlighted in red

## Dependencies
- React.js
